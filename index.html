	Hello, I am Dale Riechert, a recent graduate of informatics and digital culture at Arizona State University.<br><br>
	Informatics is an interdisciplinary field incorporating areas such as computer science, information systems, and human computer interaction. I am what comes between data, computers, and people. As we head deeper into the 21st century these computer systems are playing an ever bigger role, becoming essential to nearly every other field out there. Digital culture is the study of digital media and the digital systems in our everyday life, bringing creative solutions to today and tomorrow's problems. <br><br>
	My passions include the video game and consumer technology industries. I also hold interests in graphic design, photography, foreign culture, film, and more. As a hobby I like to collect, mostly Russian and mechanical, wristwatches.

    <h3>Capstone Project</h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
    As a senior capstone project my team created an internal webpage for the <a href="http://MyHelixHouse.com">Helix House</a> digital advertising agency. This page conglomerates individual client marketing data from different services: Google Analytics, Google Ads, and Twilio. I built the HTML/CSS based on provided wireframes and assisted in PHP API integration and functionality. Helix House will test drive the webpage to analyze possible improvements, but was thrilled that our deliverable was fully functional.

    <h3>Light Through Matter</h3>
    This media installation combines a MIDI keyboard with a projector, so as the pianist plays, shapes are projected onto the transparent fabric suspended above them. The note's octave determines the color, and tempo determines the speed. I created the Max patch that the system runs on while also assisting in construction and installing of the equipment.

    <h3>Computer Interface Feedback Through Haptics</h3>
    This project aimed to explore brain plasticity and sensory replacement by replacing the computer mouse cursor with vibration feedback. The cursor's X and Y position, as well as the color of the item the cursor was positioned over, were each mapped to a vibration motor. The system was built with an Arduino, Max, and an HTML/CSS webpage on a laptop computer.

    <h3>Vulgar Phone Cases</h3>
    As a group project, we had to utilize data representing vulgarity in the fabrication of some surface. We chose to use the occurances of swear words in our text messages and then mapping that data onto 3D-printable phone cases. The phone case models were loaded into Rhinocerous 3D, with the data mapping occuring in Grasshopper. I created this Grasshopper definition for the rest of the group to use.

    <h3>Letter Frequency Keyboard</h3>
    This was an individual project in which I took a similar approach as the Vulgarity project above. Using 3D models of keyboard keycaps, I modified each of them using Grasshopper based on each letter's frequency in the English language before having them 3D printed and arranged.

    <h3>Personal Website</h3>
	This website is written with HTML/CSS from scratch and some JavaScript. It is hosted on my <a href="http://github.com/daleriechert/daleriechert.github.io">GitHub</a>.
    <br><br>
	<h3>Motion Control Drum Machine</h3>
    This is an interactive drum machine using an Arduino and potentiometers for note adjustment, a Wii remote and GlovePIE for motion control, and Max for note processing and system communication. Each time the user swings the remote, in the order indicated by the LEDs, one of the six notes will play.

    <h3>Big Cosmonaut Game</h3>
    Taking my previous game from 2D to 3D, this short game was developed in Unity using free assets. The player must reach the spaceship before a meteor destroys everything.

    <h3>Phone App Design 2</h3>
    This was a team project to develop an app idea into a visual prototype in Justinmind. Called Roommate Fu, this app would be a chore organizer for roommates. I constructed the prototype while consulting with team members.

    <h3>ASU Research Website</h3>
    This project tasked each team with redesigning the ASU Research Integrity website and building a functional prototype. Each prototype was evaluated through user testing and the results were given to ASU for consideration in a final design. My team focused on streamlining the application process and uniformly organizing the large amounts of information. I constructed the prototype while consulting with team members, and assisted in collecting and evaluating user data.

    <h3>Phone App Design</h3>
    This was a team project to develop an app idea into a visual prototype in Axure. This app would allow a user to see what public trasit they would need to use in order to meet all of their plans for the day. I assisted in prototype construction and editing.

    <h3>Blog System</h3>
	This is a basic blog system written with HTML/CSS, PHP, and MySQL. Administrators are able to control content while visitors may leave comments on entries.

	<h3>Little Cosmonaut Game</h3>
	This is a simple game built in GameMaker using my own assets. It is a vertical platformer, the catch is that gravity decreases the higher up the player climbs, causing more dynamic and interesting physics. The goal is to reach the top with the fastest time.

    <h3>Keyboard Switch Tester</h3>
    Using LEDs, a Teensy USB microcontroller, and AutoHotkey, I gave this dummy keyboard switch tester some life. It now makes a cool desk toy and controls media and volume functions on my desktop computer.
